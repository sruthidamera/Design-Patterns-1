Fan Speed Control:
-> States represent the speed levels of a fan, such as "Off", "Low", "Medium", "High" .
-> Each state have methods that represent events like increaseSpeed(), decreaseSpeed(), and turnOff().
-> The fan changes its state as per events and the state it is in. (intial state is Off)
-> The fan needs to increase, decrease and turn off its cooling and voltage as per its state changes.

State Transitions:
